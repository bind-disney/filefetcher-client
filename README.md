### Description

This is a simple FTP-like command-line client written in Go.

### Installation

`go get github.com/bind-disney/filefetcher-client`

### Usage

You need to specify server domain name or IP address through `-H` option, server port through `-P` option
(by default it is 27518) and target directory (by default it is `downloads`), where files will be stored
by default, if not specified while downloading a file.

When the connection to the server is successfully established, you can use simple FTP-like commands:

* `list` / `ls` for listing files in the current remote directory
* `chdir` / `cd` for changing current remote directory
* `get` / `download` / `fetch` for downloading a file
* `help` / `h` for showing this usage help
* `exit` / `quit` / `q` for quiting the application

##### Warning

* Directory downloading is not supported yet
* File names with spaces are not supported yet
